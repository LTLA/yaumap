Title: Yet Another UMAP Implementation
Description: 
    Provides a bare-bones implementation of the popular UMAP algorithm,
    based on the umappp C++ library. Created primarily to test the C++
    library itself, but feel free to use it for actual work. Just put 
    in some data and get out some UMAP coordinates; nothing else to say.
