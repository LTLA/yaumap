# Yet another UMAP package

This package provides R bindings for the [**umappp**](https://github.com/LTLA/umappp) C++ library.
It is mostly intended for use by **umappp** developers in testing and experimentation; it is not particularly recommended for actual usage in data analyses.
End-users are advised to use the [**uwot**](https://github.com/jlmelville/uwot) package instead.
